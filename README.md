# Salifort-Motors-Employee-Data-Analysi

As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, ideas were generated on how to increase employee retention based on the results of a recent employee survey. To help the senior management with this, a model was designed that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their department, number of projects, average monthly hours, satisfaction level, tenure in the company and whether they have been promoted in the last 5 years. If employees likely to quit can be predicted before hand, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

Based on the relationship between the variables in the dataset, 2 modelling approaches were tried out - one being the Logistic Regression and the other being a tree-based approach using both Decision tree and Random forest classifiers. The final model was chosen based on metric scores and the most crucial features for an employee leaving the company were identified to enable thestakeholders take actions about the same.

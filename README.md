# Salifort-Motors-Employee-Data-Analysis


## 📋 Project Overview

As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, ideas were generated on how to increase employee retention based on the results of a recent employee survey. To help the senior management with this, a model was designed that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their department, number of projects, average monthly hours, satisfaction level, tenure in the company and whether they have been promoted in the last 5 years. If employees likely to quit can be predicted before hand, it might be possible to identify factors that contribute to their leaving. Because it is time-consuming and expensive to find, interview, and hire new employees, increasing employee retention will be beneficial to the company.

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ Perform comprehensive EDA to understand the structure, quality, and characteristics of the dataset.
- ✅ Clean and transform raw data into an analysis-ready format by handling duplicate values and outliers.
- ✅ Perform feature engineering to prepare the columns for modelling.
- ✅ Identify correlation among certain features in the dataset as well as detect class imbalance within the target variable.
- ✅ Finalize a machine learning model which works well with both the training and test data.
- ✅ Analyze the presicion, recall and accuracy scores of each model and decide the most suitable one for deployment.

## 📊 Methodology

Based on the relationship between the variables in the dataset, 2 modelling approaches were tried out - one being the Logistic Regression and the other being a tree-based approach using both Decision tree and Random forest classifiers. The final model was chosen based on metric scores and the most crucial features for an employee leaving the company were identified to enable thestakeholders take actions about the same.

## 📈 Outcome

The analysis provides actionable insights to help Salifort motors align working hours, promotions and number of projects with the interests of employees, to better meet their expectations and reduce their likelihood of leaving the company.
The most important features for the tree based models were the average monthly working hours of employees, their tenure in the company, the number of projects alotted to them and evaluation.
